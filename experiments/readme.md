## Fist set of experiments
We conduct a first set of experiments in CLEFIP-2011-0.54M to exemplify the ensemble frameworkâ€™s potential and evaluate the effectiveness of ensemble systems against base classifiers:

## Second set of experiments
To validate the effectiveness of ensemble systems against SotA methods, we conduct another set of experiments. In this set, we train the same Bi-LSTM base classifiers on different vertical data partitions and combine their knowledge to create an ensemble system.
