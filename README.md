# This code has been created for running the experiments for the publication "An Ensemble Framework for Text Classification".
This repository contains two main folders. The first folder is named "experiments" and contains the experiments made in the CLEFIP-0.54M, WIPO-alpha, USPTO-2M, WoS and EURLEX57K. The second folder is named "datasets" and provides links and other details for the datasets.

## Requiquirements

We conduct a first set of experiments to exemplify the ensemble frameworkâ€™s potential and evaluate the effectiveness of ensemble systems against base classifiers. Specifically, we create representative instantiations of the ensemble framework, demonstrating different ways to design an ensemble system and evaluating the effectiveness of combining knowledge against base classifiers.
