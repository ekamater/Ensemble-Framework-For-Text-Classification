We used two different language models. 

### GLOVE language model
For the WOS and EURLEX, the pre-trained GLOVE language model with 300 dimensions is used, which is available here: [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

### Patent domain language model by Risch and Krestel
For patent domain datasets, a domain-specific pre-trained language model with 300 dimensions is used, described by Risch and Krestel in  [1](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/dta-01-2019-0002/full/html). The language models created in this paper are made available [here](https://hpi.de/naumann/projects/web-science/paar-patent-analysis-and-retrieval/patent-classification.html). However, for accessing the language model with 300 dimensions, you should send a request to the responsible of the language model. Mailto:julian.risch@alumni.uni-potsdam.de.
